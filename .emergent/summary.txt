The trajectory outlines the initial development phase of a mobile Android application for listing hotels and homestays, named StayHunt. The process began with the user providing a comprehensive list of requirements, including core features like property listing, search, filtering, and a backend for data management, as well as advanced features like user authentication, subscriptions, and AI-powered suggestions. An Excel file was provided as the initial data source.

The AI engineer clarified the initial scope with the user, agreeing to prioritize the core listing and search functionality (Phase 1). Following this, the engineer established a full-stack architecture using Expo (React Native) for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.

The engineer successfully implemented the basic backend API endpoints in  and a foundational UI in . To make the application functional, a data seeding script, , was created to parse the user's Excel file and populate the MongoDB database with sample property data. The last completed action was the successful execution of this seeding script. The immediate next step, as stated by the previous engineer, was to test the implemented features.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build an Android mobile application for browsing and discovering hotels and homestays, initially focusing on the North Bengal region.

**Phase 1 (Completed MVP):**
- Display a list of properties sourced from a provided Excel sheet.
- Each listing must show a photo, contact number, and a link to Google Maps.
- Implement a search functionality for properties and locations.
- Provide filtering options based on location, amenities, and tariff range, with sorting by price.
- The application must have a backend API to serve the property data to the mobile app.

**Future Phases (Pending):**
- User authentication via Google/social media.
- A subscription model for unlimited access to contact details.
- A separate interface for property owners to manage their listings after verification.
- Integration of AI for property suggestions.
- Push notifications and ad placements.
- A system to prompt users for Google Play Store reviews.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Expo (React Native) frontend, FastAPI (Python) backend, and a MongoDB database.
- **Data Seeding:** A Python script () was used to parse an Excel file and populate the MongoDB collection with initial data.
- **API Development:** A basic REST API was created using FastAPI to serve property data from the database to the frontend application.
- **Phased Development:** The project is broken down into manageable phases, starting with a core MVP for listing and search.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack monorepo structure with separate  and  directories. The frontend is an Expo application, and the backend is a FastAPI server.

**Directory Structure:**


**File Details:**

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the core of the backend. It sets up the FastAPI application, establishes the connection to the MongoDB database, and defines the API endpoints required to fetch property data for the frontend.
    -   **Changes:** Created from scratch to implement the initial API for listing properties, including search and pagination logic.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the main entry point and the primary screen for the mobile application. It contains the React Native code responsible for fetching data from the backend API and rendering the list of hotels and homestays for the user.
    -   **Changes:** Created from scratch to build the basic user interface for displaying property listings.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** A one-time utility script created to populate the database. It reads the  file provided by the user, processes the data, and inserts it into the MongoDB  collection.
    -   **Changes:** Created to facilitate initial development and testing by providing sample data to the application. It was run once successfully.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Phase 2: Authentication & Subscription:** Implement Google OAuth, define user roles (Guest vs. Owner), and build the subscription system with payment integration.
- **Phase 3: Owner Management:** Develop features for property owners to claim, verify, and manage their listings.
- **Phase 4: Advanced Features:** Integrate AI for suggestions, add push notifications, and implement the review/rating system.
- Implement UI/UX enhancements to make the design more eye-catching as requested.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The project has just completed its initial development phase (Phase 1), focusing on core functionality. A foundational technology stack has been established with an Expo frontend, FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

The previous engineer created the necessary files for this MVP:
1.  **:** A FastAPI server with an API endpoint (likely ) to list properties from the database.
2.  **:** A basic React Native screen to display the list of properties fetched from the backend.
3.  **:** A script to populate the database from the user-provided Excel file.

The most recent action was the successful execution of the  script, which populated the MongoDB database with 10 sample property listings. The application is now in a state where the basic listing feature is implemented and backed by real data, making it ready for initial testing and review.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Test the core functionality of the application to ensure the frontend correctly fetches and displays the property data from the backend API.
