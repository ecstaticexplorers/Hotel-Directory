The trajectory details the handoff of a mobile application project, StayHunt, from a previous AI engineer to a new one. The initial state is a completed Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for listing hotels and homestays. The architecture is a full-stack setup with an Expo (React Native) frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

The previous engineer had successfully built the core API endpoints (), the basic frontend UI (), and a data seeding script () which populated the database with a small sample of 10 properties from an Excel file.

The new session begins with the user providing a new, explicit instruction: First upload the entire data from the excel. This overrides the previous engineer's plan to start with testing. The current engineer correctly identifies this new priority. The subsequent actions involve locating the source Excel file () in the project assets after failing to find it in the local directory. The last action was confirming the file's location and stating the intent to extract its data and create a proper seed script to populate the database with the complete dataset, moving beyond the initial sample data.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to develop StayHunt, an Android application for discovering hotels and homestays, starting with the North Bengal region.

**Phase 1 (Completed MVP):**
The application currently displays a list of properties sourced from a provided Excel sheet. Core features implemented include a basic property listing view showing a photo, contact number, and a Google Maps link. A backend API serves this data, and initial functionality for search and filtering (by location, amenities, tariff) has been established.

**Current Task:**
The immediate requirement is to fully populate the application's database with all property listings contained within the  file, replacing the initial 10-item sample dataset.

**Future Phases (Pending):**
Future development includes user authentication (Google/social media), a subscription model for premium features, a portal for property owners to manage listings, AI-powered suggestions, and push notifications.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Architecture:** Expo (React Native) for the frontend, FastAPI (Python) for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.
- **Data Seeding:** A Python script () using pandas and Motor (async MongoDB driver) to parse an Excel file and populate the database.
- **REST API:** A basic API developed with FastAPI to serve property data to the mobile application.
- **Phased Development:** The project is structured into distinct phases, starting with an MVP and incrementally adding features.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with distinct  and  directories.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This file contains the core FastAPI application logic. It defines the API endpoints (e.g., ) that the frontend uses to fetch property data from MongoDB. It handles database connections and business logic for searching and filtering.
    -   **Changes:** No changes have been made in the current trajectory, but it will be tested after the data seeding is complete.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the entry point and main screen of the Expo mobile app. It's responsible for making API calls to the backend and rendering the list of properties to the user.
    -   **Changes:** No changes have been made in the current trajectory.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This script is crucial for populating the database. It was initially used to load a small sample of data. It is the central focus of the current task.
    -   **Changes:** The script was read to understand its existing logic. It will be modified to parse the complete  file and insert all records into the MongoDB  collection, replacing the old sample data.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Primary Task:** Modify and execute the  script to upload the entire dataset from the Excel file into the MongoDB database.
- **Secondary Tasks:**
    - Test the core application functionality after the database is fully populated.
    - Implement future phases: user authentication, subscriptions, and owner management portals.
    - Enhance the UI/UX to be more eye-catching.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate focus is on a data migration task explicitly requested by the user: populating the MongoDB database with the complete set of listings from the provided  file. The project's initial state only contained 10 sample properties, which is insufficient for proper testing or a real-world use case.

The engineer has successfully navigated the initial steps of this task. After confirming the user's request, the engineer inspected the existing  script to understand its structure. The next crucial step was locating the source Excel file. After initial checks in the local file system failed, the engineer successfully found the  file within the project's remote assets.

The work concluded with the confirmation of finding the file. The engineer is now prepared to proceed with reading the data from this Excel file and updating the seed script to perform a full and complete data load into the database.

<optional_next_step>
Extract the data from the located  file and update  to populate the entire dataset into the database.
